          <strong>Technologies of Monastic Devotion and Prayer.</strong> The
          diagram of the <i>Mount of Perfection</i> by St. John of the Cross in
          the light of sound experience.

          This research focuses on understanding the diagram of the Mount of
          Perfection drawn by the Spanish Carmelite monk John of the Cross.
          Starting from an analysis of methods of prayer from the ancient
          contemplative Carmelite order with roots in Palestine and from the
          theology of Eastern Christianity, the diagram is studied as a
          pedagogical method and as spiritual communication which employs social
          and mental prayer as principal tools for reaching a state of divine
          contemplation.

        <p>
          The study examines the diagram from the theocentric and
          orbicular thought that antecede it, establishing links with the circular
          design of the graphical music symbols which appeared in the second half
          of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century with the
          emergence of animated scores. The purpose of this research is the
          creation of prototypes of animated scores taking as a point of reference
          the diagrammatic visual designs generated in a sacred and religious
          context. This idea invites a dialogue between spirituality, art, and
          technology.
