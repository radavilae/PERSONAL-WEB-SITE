        <p>
          Raúl Dávila's music centers around the idea of cutting and that which
          cuts. His compositional practice, as well as his exploration with the
          electric guitar, creates a sound that oscillates between two opposite
          yet complementary extremes. On one side, there is the discontinuity of
          sound through the use of noise, voltage, and electricity; on the other,
          there is sound that remains static, continuous, and expands time to
          create immersive sound spaces for contemplation through the exploration
          of the harmonic spectrum and deep listening.

          Musician and researcher in Humanities, Arts, and Technology. He holds a
          PhD in Humanities from Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Raúl Dávila's
          research centres on the study of diagrammatic thought in sixteenth
          century mystic literature and its relationship with the aesthetic
          experience of contemporary culture and new media. He has two degrees in
          musical composition, one from the Faculty of Music of the National
          Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the other from School of Music
          of the National Centre for the Arts, both in Mexico City, as well as a
          Masters in Comparative Literature, Art and Thought from Pompeu Fabra
          University. Specialising in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a
          particular focus on Natural Language Processing, his work considers the
          construction of language from the perspective of mystic science and
          computers. His own aesthetic proposal both visual and sound, comes from
          the concept that he developed himself and has named
          <i>La Estética del Corte </i> (The Aesthetic of the Cut). Since 2018, he
          has been involved in the field of independent publishing as co-founder
          of the publishing platform Urbild Editions. His musical and visual work,
          has been shown in Caixa Forum (BCN-L); Lunario del Auditorio Nacional
          (CDMX); Sala Blas Galindo (CDMX); Fonoteca Nacional (CDMX); Centro de
          Cultura Digital (CDMX); Museu etnológic i de cultures del Món (BCN);
          Leopold-Hoesch-Museum, (DÜREN); Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien, (BER);
